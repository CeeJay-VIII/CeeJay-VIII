# README.md
Greetings! I am Siyavuya Chagi, a seasoned software developer hailing from the beautiful town of Bizana in the Eastern Cape. My primary focus lies in C#, but I am also proficient in a diverse range of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, Node.Js, Linux NDG, and Microsoft Azure.
I have a never-ending passion for learning and constantly seek out new knowledge to stay ahead of the curve. My unrelenting dedication to perfection and tireless work ethic make me a valuable addition to any team.

When I am not coding, I love nothing more than curling up with a good book or heading out to explore the great outdoors.
